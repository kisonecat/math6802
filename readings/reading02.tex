\maketitle

From Hatcher's \textit{Algebraic Topology}, read \textsection 2.3 The
Formal Viewpoint, which is an opportunity for us to review the
``axiomatic'' perspective on homology.  Also read the first couple
pages of Chapter~3, Cohomology.

This is a shortened week, and we're still having lecture via Zoom, and
we're still in the introductory period of this course, where we're
reviewing homology.  Be sure to use your time wisely to consolidate
your prior learning from Math~6801.  What are you still finding
confusing about Math~6801?  Homology of pairs?  Excision?  How
comfortable are you doing these homological calculations?

And why is this axiomatic perspective so important?  It turns out that
there are \textit{other} homology theories, and the Eilenberg-Steenrod
axioms are capturing the essential properties that all homology
theories have in common.  The history is also important: the language
of functors and categories was invented (discovered?) precisely to
make precise the comparison between different homology theories.
