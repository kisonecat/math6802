From Hatcher's \textit{Algebraic Topology}, read \textsection 2.3 The
Formal Viewpoint, which is an opportunity for us to review the
``axiomatic'' perspective on homology.  Also read the first couple
pages of Chapter~3, Cohomology.

This is a shortened week and we're still in the introductory period of
this course, where we're reviewing homology.  Be sure to use your time
wisely to consolidate your prior learning from Math~6801.  What are
you still finding confusing about Math~6801?  Homology of pairs?
Excision?  How comfortable are you doing these homological
calculations?

And why is this axiomatic perspective so important?  It turns out that
there are \textit{other} homology theories, and the Eilenberg-Steenrod
axioms are capturing the essential properties that all homology
theories have in common.  The history is also important: the language
of functors and categories was invented (discovered?) precisely to
make precise the comparison between different homology theories.
